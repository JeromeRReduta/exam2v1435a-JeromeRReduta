# Exam 2 Code Snippets

This repository contains two code snippet questions. You import this repository into Eclipse as a "Maven Java project" in the same way you import homework repositories.

There are no unit tests provided.

However, Github Actions is setup such that you can see your score every time you commit and push to your homework repository.

  1. To view your current score, click on the "[Actions](actions/)" tab, then the "**Github Classroom Workflow**" link, and then the link for the most recent action run.

  2. To see details on what passed or failed, from the page with your score, click the "**Autograding**" link and open the "**Run Autograder**" section.

For more details, view the `README.md` file in the subdirectory that starts with `Exam2` (it is also accessible within your Eclipse workspace).

:warning: *Your code will be examined to make sure you implemented the desired functionality and did not modify the code to just produce the output expected by the specific tests.*

:stop_sign: *Do not tamper with the repository setup. Modifying the Github Action or other forms of tampering will be considered a violation of the Academic Honesty Policy.*
